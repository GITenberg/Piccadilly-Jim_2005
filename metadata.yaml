description: "Piccadilly Jim is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the\
  \ United States on 24 February 1917 by Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, and in\
  \ the United Kingdom in May 1918 by Herbert Jenkins, London. The story had previously\
  \ appeared in the US in the Saturday Evening Post between 16 September and 11 November\
  \ 1916.\nThe novel features Ogden Ford and his mother Nesta (both previously encountered\
  \ in The Little Nugget (1913)). Nesta has remarried, to the hen-pecked, baseball-loving\
  \ millionaire Mr. Peter Pett, and Ogden remains spoilt and obnoxious. The story\
  \ takes its title from the charismatic character of Jimmy Crocker, Nesta's nephew\
  \ and a reforming playboy. 'Jim' is called upon to assist in the kidnapping of Ogden,\
  \ amongst much confusion involving imposters, crooks, detectives, butlers, aunts\
  \ etc. - all in the name of romance of course.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
